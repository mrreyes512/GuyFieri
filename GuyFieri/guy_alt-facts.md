# Alternate Facts from Guy

I have a pet fast-casual restaurant named Applebees in my backyard. Anytime I get a negative review on Guy's American Kitchen™ I go there to feel better.

Did you know: the film "The Toxic Avenger" is loosely based on me?

I don't have Battletoads but I DO have an unopened copy of Super Madden Tennis Ate My Neighbors '98 for the Sega Xcube

The best part about living in a dumpster is all this room for Nachos! Like my latest invention: Guy Fieri®'s Signature Sicked-Out Tricked-Out Oops! All Cheese Nachos™, we've swapped out those old-school, basic chips for cheese, then carefully topped them with Donkey Sauce®, then hand-mixed them using our signature Hulk Hands before body-slamming them in a real WWE Hell In A Cell CageMatch ring for a 1-2-3 that'll make you say 'gimme gimme'
